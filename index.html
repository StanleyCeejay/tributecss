        >Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (born Rolihlahla Mandela /mæn'dɛlə/;
        Xhosa:[xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂:la]; 18 July 1918 - 5 December 2013)</strong
      >
      was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader and
      philanthropist who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994
      to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first
      elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government
      focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling
      institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation.
      Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the
      president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

      A Xhosa speaker, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo,
      Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and
      the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in
      Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African
      nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth
      League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government
      established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged
      whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. He was
      appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence
      for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of
      the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was
      unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by
      Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party
      (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in
      association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in
      1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested
      and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to
      life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state.
